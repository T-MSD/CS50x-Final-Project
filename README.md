### Description:

This is my CS50x Final Project submission, a Flappy Bird game using Lua with [LOVE 2D](https://love2d.org/wiki/Main_Page).
  
The game is designed to be played on 1920x1080 resolution since all the .png dimensions are specific to fit in a 1920x1080 window wihout needing to be rescaled. I used photoshop to draw all the assets except the buttons. Feel free to use the .psd files to make any modifications. [Button assets.](https://nectanebo.itch.io/menu-buttons)
##### How to play:
  - Press "space" to jump and "ESC" to pause, that's all you need.
